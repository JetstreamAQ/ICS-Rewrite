  - name: "JETSTRM495"
    flavor: "A Salvaged direlect, repurposed by pirates for void travel."
    desc: |
          Designed over 200 years ago, this fighter was originally created as a bomber
          which could operate both in and out of an atmospheric environment.  Equipped
          with minature C-grade mana factories, set to produce about 50 dumb Storm
          missiles per second and hold around 500 in storage.  To complement this,
          the bomber has been fitted with, what are now, E-grade thrusters and engines
          -- allowing it to travel just a little under the speed of light.

          Now replaced with the introduction of Wight fighters, this specific obsolete
          bomber has had it's mana factories removed and replaced with auxillary fuel
          tanks.  In lieu of this, it now sports a single fighter-grade Desperado
          Autocannon, turning it into barely passable void suitable transport.

  - name: "Wight"
    flavor: "The standard Galactic Hegemony void travel capable fighter."
    desc: |
          With the discovery of what has been dubbed: the Void; about 50 years ago,
          the Galactic Hegemony found that their JETSTRM495 fighter-bombers and
          Saber interceptors were outmatched by the confusing entities found
          within.  To maintain their authority over all known space, the Galactic
          Hegemony soon cooked up the Wight SSF-004; arming it with -- what was,
          at the time -- Alter Corporation's revolutionary plasma repeaters,
          coupled with solid state fuel pellets for extended independent flight.

          The Wight SSF-004 has since been the go-to small craft fighter for many
          captains of Atlas carriers within the Hegemony Navy's Void division.
