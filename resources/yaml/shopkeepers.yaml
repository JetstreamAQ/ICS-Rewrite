        Greetings walker!  Are you in need of supplies?  If so
        then my freighter's warp drive is still functional, and
        I'm able to send over any needed item...  That is, of
        course, if you have the coin.

        Apologies, traveller.  My transponder has been damaged
        so I'm unable to transmit my GHID-# until I get another
        one.  In the mean time, if you have any credits, I'm
        more than willing to sell some of my wares to you for
